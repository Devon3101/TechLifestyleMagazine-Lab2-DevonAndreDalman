## ðŸ§  Design Choices

- **Semantic HTML5 Tags**: Used `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to improve readability, structure, and accessibility.
- **Consistent Typography**: Set a global `font-family` with fallback fonts (`Arial`, `Helvetica`, `sans-serif`) for consistency across devices.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Applied different heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) with distinct font sizes and spacing to guide the readerâ€™s eye.
- **Color Scheme & Branding**: Chose a navy blue (`rgb(3, 38, 69)`) and orange (`rgba(255, 68, 0, 0.74)`) palette to create contrast and align with a modern tech-lifestyle theme.
- **Hover & Transition Effects**: Added hover states and smooth transitions to buttons, navigation links, and images to enhance interactivity.
- **Responsive Layout**: Used **Flexbox** for layouts (`nav ul`, `.articles`, `.article-item`) and applied **media queries** for mobile optimization.
- **Card-Based Design**: Articles are styled as **cards** with shadows, rounded corners, and hover animations for a clean, modern feel.
